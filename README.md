## About me




- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code better. I'm really interested in database management even if I don't have any experience in it. 
- 👯 I’m still learning, so maybe someday I'll colaborate but it's still a bit too soon. 
- 😄 Pronouns: They/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I never really followed a course about IT. I just learn as I go, and fell in love with this field.[^1]


[^1]:I'm not a person, but an egg, mind the temperature and humidity to incubate me.
